QUIQQER Translator
========

The quiqqer / translation package extends QUIQQER with a translation panel and translation functions.
With the quiqqer / translator it is possible to edit / add or delete translation variables.
In addition, translations (locale.xml files) can be imported and exported.

Translations are stored in different formats, so that translations can be used for high performance.
JavaScript (client) and PHP (server) variables are processed separately and made available.

An attempt is made to access gettext (http://php.net/manual/de/book.gettext.php)
if this is not supported the server will use normal ini files.
